# MovieMate-Movies-recommender-system

MovieMate is a movie recommendation system built using Python and data from IMDb. It helps users find movies they might enjoy based on content features (like genre and description) and popularity factors (such as ratings and votes). The project explores three types of recommendation methods: content-based, collaborative, and hybrid filtering.

## Project Overview

With so many movies available online, it can be difficult for users to decide what to watch. This project aims to solve that by recommending movies that are similar to those a user already likes. MovieMate uses data from IMDbâ€™s top 1000 movies and applies machine learning techniques to build and evaluate recommendation systems.

## Features

- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends movies that are similar in genre or storyline.
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Recommends movies based on features like rating, votes, revenue, and metascore.
- **Hybrid Filtering**: Combines content and collaborative similarity scores for broader results.
- **Evaluation**: Models are tested using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, NDCG, and MAP.
- **Result**: The collaborative model showed the best performance overall.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
